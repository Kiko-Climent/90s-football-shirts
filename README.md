## E-Comerce Type

90's Football Shirts operates as a B2C business, functioning as a digital online store where users can purchase retro sports kits. The primary objective for the administrator is to successfully implement CRUD functionality.

## Marketng

90's football shirts has decided to use social media marketing as the main technique in the development and spread of the content on the page. The social network _Facebook_ was chosen to implement this technique. You can visit the profile [Here](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61556575044215)

Email marketing was also used to create engagement with new users of the page; in this case, we opted for _Mailchimp_ as the tool.

### Color Scheme

The colors used for the site design adopt a sober and simple style. I aimed to steer away from the typical white background to impart a retro and lo-fi touch, which I believe aligns with the _vintage_ concept of the page. Additionally, the muted blue tone complements perfectly with the landing page image.

### Typography

The font used for the development of the site was _Kanit_

![Products](media/readme_media/all_products_page.png)

### Product Detail Page:
Selecting a desired item, we enter the product details, where a slightly longer description takes center stage. In addition to the fields mentioned earlier, the product includes a brief text describing the team, its achievements, and some interesting memorabilia.

_Size_ and _Quantity_ selection buttons are included, with a maximum of 5 units per item, as the allowed maximum.

At the bottom, users will find buttons to _Add the item_ to the _Shopping Cart_ and another one to navigate back to the complete list of products.

For registered users, the possibility to submit their own rating and add the product to their wishlist will also be available.

![Product Detail Page](media/readme_media/product_detail.png)

![Product Description](media/readme_media/product_detail_info.png)

![Rating](media/readme_media/rating.png)

## User's Wishlist:
Regarding the _Wishlist,_ Users can add items to the wishlist by clicking the Heart icon in the product description. The _Wishlist_ will display the products selected by the registered user in the product detail view. It's quite simple, including only the _Image, Team, Price,_ and two buttons—one to access the _Product Details_ again and another to _Remove_ it from the wishlist.

![Wishlist](media/readme_media/wishlist.png)

## Shopping Cart:
The shopping cart will show all users the products they have previously added. Here, in addition to the image, the team's name, and the price, the selected size and quantity will be displayed, with the option to update or remove the quantity. In the same row, a column for the product subtotal will also be available.

![Shopping Cart](media/readme_media/shopping_cart.png)

At the bottom, a cost _breakdown_ will be provided to the user. This includes the total price _before discount_, the amount to be _discounted (if applicable),_ as well as the _shipping costs (if applicable),_ and the _Grand Total,_ which is the amount the user needs to pay.

Finally, the user will find a button to return to the store and another one to proceed to the checkout page.

![Costs Resume](media/readme_media/amount_with_discount.png)

## Purchase:
On the Purchase page, we find a _summary_ of the user's cart at the top right. Meanwhile, on the left side, there is a form where the user will enter the _shipping details_ for the products about to be purchased. Just below, there is a field to enter _credit card information,_ as well as two buttons—one to _proceed_ with the payment and another to go _back to the cart_ in case any modifications are desired.

![Checkout](media/readme_media/purchase.png)
![Shipping Details](media/readme_media/shipping_details.png)
![Resume](media/readme_media/products_resume.png)

### Purchase-Success:
After the payment has been processed, the user will be redirected to the _Purchase Success_ page. In addition to a _confirmation message_ at the top, the _details_ related to the purchase will be displayed. A _Confirmation email_ will also be sent to the email address provided by the user earlier.

![Checkout Success](media/readme_media/purchase_success.png)
![Purchase confirmation email](media/readme_media/order_confirmation_email.png)

## Profile:
### User's Profile:
The user profile consists of 2 sections, the first one with the _shipping details_ of the users that can be modified if the user wishes, and another section where the _Previous Orders_ will be stored.

![Profile](/media/readme_media/users_profile.png)

Clicking on any of the past orders redirects us to the "Purchase Success" page for that specific order, with a message informing the user

![Past Orders](media/readme_media/past_orders.png)

## Contact
### Contact Form:
The _Contact form,_ available in the dropdown menu of the _accounts icon,_ is accessible to _all users,_ whether registered or not. In it, the fields to provide a response are mandatory. As for the _Subject,_ the user can choose between _General Inquiry_ or _Product._ Another dropdown menu that includes a list of all the products in the store will also be provided to ensure a good experience for both the admin and the user. In the _Message_ field, the user can explain the inquiry to the administrator.

![Contact](/media/readme_media/contact_form.png)

### Contact Success
Once the fields have been filled out successfully, a confirmation message as well as an email will be provided to the user.

![Contact Success](/media/readme_media/contact_success.png)
![Contact Confirmation Email](/media/readme_media/contact_confirmation_email.png)

## Management:
The page administrator will have the ability to create new content for the page, as well as edit or delete existing content.

In the _Accounts_ icon, only the authenticated administrator will see a link labeled _Management,_ which will redirect them to the page for uploading new products to the store.

### Add New Product:
The form for _adding new products_ to the store includes all the fields that will later be displayed in the product _description_ within the _Product Detail_ page.
![Add New Product](/media/readme_media/add_product.png)

### Edit / Delete Product:
Within the Product Detail page, if the authenticated user is the administrator, a new field will be displayed in the description where they can update or delete the product. Both links are also avilable from the _All Products_ page.

![Delete Product](/media/readme_media/delete_product.png)
![Edit Product](/media/readme_media/edit_product.png)
![](media/readme_media/all_products_management.png)

### 404 Error:

![404](media/readme_media/404_error.png)


### Future Implementations
The project was initially created with the possibility that items without sizes would also be accommodated. Products like retro-style scarves or caps are some things that could be implemented on the site in the future.

A _Blog_ section was also highly present in the project's development. A place where retro football enthusiasts could discuss great moments in football history, iconic players, unforgettable goals, and legendary matches. Undoubtedly, it would be a great addition to the site.

It could also be implemented a functionality where the user, in addition to being able to leave the rating, could provide _feedback_ after experiencing a purchase, for example. This would enhance the user experience.

# Web Marketing

## Email Marketing:
_Mailchimp_ was used in order to implement a Web marketing strategy. Users can find the registration form located inside the footer and just by entering the email adress they will be automatically subscribed to the Monthly newsletter.

![Newsletter](media/readme_media/newsletter.png)

## Search Engine Optimization:
SEO words selected as keywords:

![Meta Tags](/media/readme_media/meta_tags.png)
![Wordtracker](/media/readme_media/wordtracker.png)
![Wordtracker](/media/readme_media/wordtracker2.png)

Apparently, Wordtracker has changed its configuration, and unfortunately, I was only able to perform one search, and another one in incognito mode.

## Social Media:
_Facebook_ was used as plattform to develope the _Social media marketing_. Due to the simplicity and scope i thought it would be the best tool to implement it the social media strategy.

I had an issue that took up a significant part of my last afternoon before submitting the project. In my live version, when redirecting to the admin panel, the page seemed not to pick up the static files, having this appearance:

It was very weird cause all the ther static and media files were displaying well. After many research attempts, I reorganized the installed apps of my project within the settings file. I deleted all the static files belonging to the admin folder inside Cloudinary. None of this seemed to work, but after searching for solutions with two different tutors, we saw that deleting DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC on Heroku made everything work well."

***CIRCULAR IMPORT***
While creating the functionality for ratings on the page, I had to make modifications to the Product model by creating a function to calculate an average of user ratings. When performing migrations, they were giving an error until I discovered that a **circular import** was occurring with the rating models since I was trying to import the _Rating_ model at the topl level of the file. To solve this, I performed a **local import** in the 'avg_rating' function in the Products model

***SIZES NOT GETTING RENDERED***
I also found a bug when adding products to the shopping cart. When a product was selected a with a specific size, the size was not getting rendered in the shopping cart. As I mentioned earlier, the page was initially created with the possibility of adding eventually products that did not have sizes, which is why in the Product model, I set initially the field _has sizes = False._ So all the products added from the fixtures filed didnt get the sizes rendered. Once the admin front was created in order to add and edit new products i could, with the admin credentials, edit the default field _sizes_ to yes.

***404 ERROR WHEN ADDING ITEMS TO WIHSLIST WITH NEW REGISTERED USERS***
During the development process and in the live version, I found that new registered users, when trying to access their wishlist without having added any products to the list, encountered a 404 error. The problem was resolved once products were added to the wishlist, even if the list remained empty, the error message did not appear. However, the issue persisted for new registrations.

To address this bug, I created a **try/except** block to handle the _Wishlist does Not Exist_ in my code, and thus, I was able to eliminate it.

***SMTP***
When implementing the functionality to send email notifications to users via Gmail, I found that _SMTP_ was not compatible with the current version of Django I was using. Initially, I tried to update the Django version, but this led to the need to update all my installed libraries and ElephantSQL.ç

Ultimately, I decided to roll back, reinstall the versions I had of Django and its corresponding packages, and include a runtime.txt file with the Django version required for SMTP to continue without issues in the development process

# Deployment
The version control to develope this site was done with _Gitpod_ and then deplyed to Heroku following those steps:

* Log in to Heroku app
* Create New App
* Select Region (Europe)
* Then Click on create App

The new app created in Heroku has to be linked to the database, for that i created a new one in ElephanSQL:

* Log in to Elephant SQL
* Create New Instance
* Selected _Tiny Turtle_ as plan
* Then select region (EU-NORTH)
* Review
* Create Instance
* Back to the dashboard in ElepantSQL, click on instance name
* Copy the database URL
* Back again to Heroku, move to settings, in Config Vars add DATABASE_URL and paste the URL from ElephantSQL
* Moving now to Gitpod, install dj-database_url and psycopg2 to connect to the external database
* Open the terminal and freeze requirements: pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
* Import dj_database_url in settings and update the database
* Then migrate the database
* Create the superuser
* Install Gunicorn
* Create Procfile
* Commit and push to GitHub
* Moving to Heroku, connect to GitHub Repository
* Deploy from branch
* Finally Open App

# Credits

For the development of the website, I found great inspiration in other pages that also specialize in the sale of retro/vintage football jerseys. Pages like _vintagefootball.shop_ or _retrojerseys.us_ were very helpful. I wanted to distinguish myself a bit from them by offering sports kits specifically focused on the 90s.

The product photos were taken from _retrojerseys.us_ and _myretrojerseys.com._

The walkthrough project _Boutique Ado_ and _I think therefore I blog_ were immensely helpful in developing some of the website's functionalities, such as connecting with Stripe, shopping cart, user validation, or checkout, in my case, Purchase.

For the implementation of the Agile methodology, _Kasia Boguck's_ videos were of great help.

Regarding the Readme, I relied on the one _Pauline Rugwevera_ prepared for her e-commerce PP5.

I wouldn't like to finish without mentioning the exceptional work of the tutors at Code Institute, especially _Oisin, Jason, Gemma, or Sean._ Without them, the elaboration of this project would have been much more difficult. Thank you very much!
