### Color Scheme

The colors used for the site design adopt a sober and simple style. I aimed to steer away from the typical white background to impart a retro and lo-fi touch, which I believe aligns with the _vintage_ concept of the page. Additionally, the muted blue tone complements perfectly with the landing page image.

### Typography

The font used for the development of the site was _Kanit_
